Hi there! I’m Dat Hoang — a random developer based in Vietnam.

I started this blog to share my journey of building apps, exploring entrepreneurship, and figuring out the balance between coding and personal life. I don’t have all the answers, but I’ve learned a few things along the way that I hope can be helpful or at least relatable.

By day, I work on developing software and building tools to solve real-world problems. By night, I reflect on my experiences, the challenges I face, and the small wins that keep me moving forward.

This blog isn’t about grand success stories or perfect advice. It’s about sharing what I’ve learned, the mistakes I’ve made, and the lessons I’m still learning.

Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to reach out or share your own journey. We’re all figuring this out together.
