3,500 years ago, if someone had passed by Mount Sinai, they might have seen a man removing his sandals, laying down his staff, and bowing before a bush. The man wore an intense and solemn expression, as if trying to listen intently to each word being spoken. Afterward, he left with a hint of worry on his face.

That man was Moses. His story is recorded in the book of Exodus, the second book among the approximately 66 books of the Bible. At that time, the Israelites were enslaved and forced into labor by the Egyptians. Moses, a child who survived a genocide ordered by the Egyptians, grew up to lead his people out of slavery and toward the Promised Land, following the guidance of God.

Across different regions, many beliefs in various deities have arisen. Belief in divine powers provided people in ancient times with spiritual support to endure life’s challenges. Back then, gods were often associated with natural objects like the sun, moon, mountains, rivers, or symbols like a bull or a cat. People often wanted a god they could touch, someone present to listen to their prayers.

Abraham, who lived 500 years before Moses, resided with his family in the city of Ur. His family made and sold idols for worship. Observing them mold clay and create statues to sell as gods, Abraham questioned how such lifeless objects could be divine. Then, he heard the voice of God, calling him to leave his homeland and journey to the land God promised to give him—the Promised Land. The God of Abraham was unlike any other deity he had known: He had no physical form and no specific name. Today, the God of Abraham is the most widely worshipped deity, regarded as the supreme being in Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and many other religious branches. In Vietnam, He is often referred to as Chúa Cha (God the Father).

One of the most significant doctrines in the Bible is the creation account, recorded in the book of Genesis. According to it, Abraham’s God created the heavens and the earth, rivers, mountains, plants, animals, and humans. The first humans, Adam and Eve, initially lived in the Garden of Eden (possibly located somewhere in Mesopotamia). However, after committing sin, they were expelled and had to toil in the fields for their sustenance. Their descendants eventually spread across the earth.

Another theory often compared to the creation account is the theory of evolution, which posits that life arose naturally and developed from simple forms into more complex organisms through mutation and natural selection, without the involvement of a Creator.

I’ve read Genesis many times, and I believe that many details in the book might have been exaggerated or altered, but they are likely based on real-life events. For example, the story of Noah and the great flood is also recorded in many documents from different cultures. It’s plausible that the flood was a localized event in certain areas rather than one that wiped out most life on Earth.

However, I personally believe in the creation account, for two main reasons:

1. The incredible perfection and complexity of the universe and all things within it. Electrons orbit the nucleus to form atoms. Atoms combine to form molecules. Molecules create matter, which then forms all objects, living organisms, planets, stars, and galaxies. How can we believe that all this is merely a product of nature, without deliberate design? Could you throw a pile of car parts into the air and expect them to land as a fully assembled car? As someone who works in software development, I know that even a simple program requires careful calculation and design. I cannot imagine a child randomly typing on a keyboard and creating a game like Tic Tac Toe.

2.	The absence of transitional forms in evolutionary evidence. If evolution were true, why don’t we see intermediate variants of organisms? Why hasn’t there been an animal with six legs, or did having six legs render them so inefficient that they went extinct? Scientists have also not found fossils of transitional forms. So, can one species suddenly evolve into another?

For these reasons, I believe that there should be a Creator out there. Not just because I’m a Christian, but because I find it far more plausible than the theory of evolution.
