title:  "Milestone: Quick Inspect Element Hits 1000 Users"
---
It’s been a year since I launched [Quick Inspect Element](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/quick-inspect-element/dohlilhbkbmfjnaaeieffljfccgbcdoc), my Chrome extension designed to simplify the web development workflow by allowing users to quickly inspect HTML elements with just a mouse hover. I’m excited to share that the extension has now reached 1,000 users—a milestone I’m incredibly proud of.

### The Idea Behind Quick Inspect Element

As a developer, I’ve spent countless hours navigating between browser windows and DevTools, trying to inspect HTML elements and tweak their properties. The process can be time-consuming and interrupt the flow of work. That’s when I decided to create Quick Inspect Element—a tool designed to make this process faster and more efficient.

With this extension, developers can hover over any webpage element while holding the Ctrl key to instantly inspect it. No more opening DevTools just to check an element’s structure or CSS! I wanted to create something that would boost productivity and simplify a routine task that every web developer encounters.

It was the first time I developed a Chrome extension. But the features were very simple, taking me just three days to build the first working version, and a couple of hours more to fix some bugs.

### Reaching 1,000 Users in 1 Year

It’s been a year since the launch, and I’m excited to announce that Quick Inspect Element has reached 1,000 users! This achievement has been so rewarding, not just because of the number, but because it means that developers are finding real value in the tool I built.

The extension has been well-received for its simplicity, ease of use, and the time-saving benefits it brings to the table. It’s incredibly fulfilling to know that Quick Inspect Element has become a part of so many developers’ workflows, helping them streamline their development process.

Thank you to everyone who has supported Quick Inspect Element so far. Your feedback has been invaluable, and I can’t wait to see where the next year takes us!
