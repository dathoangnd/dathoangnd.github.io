title:  "Building and Launching True Devtools: My Personal Journey"
---
As a developer, I’ve always been on the lookout for tools that can make my life easier and my workflow more efficient. Over time, I found myself constantly hopping between different websites to handle simple tasks—whether it was converting data formats, testing RegExr, or working with strings and numbers. It became clear that there was a need for a centralized platform where developers could quickly access all the utilities they need, without jumping between different sites.

That’s when the idea for [True Devtools](https://truedevtools.com) was born. My goal was simple: create a free collection of powerful tools for developers, all in one place. I wanted it to be lightweight, fast, and run entirely on the client side, ensuring that no user data was ever stored.

### The Build Process

Building True Devtools was an exciting but challenging process. I started by compiling a list of more than 40 essential tools that I often used in my own projects. From there, I carefully crafted each tool, making sure it was intuitive and efficient. The goal was to have tools that were simple yet powerful, and could help developers get their tasks done quickly without a hassle.

I also wanted the app to feel smooth and lightweight. After all, no one wants to deal with clunky, slow-loading tools when they’re in the middle of a project. By focusing on client-side performance, I ensured that True Devtools runs seamlessly, with no unnecessary server-side processes or delays.

This was also the first production app I built using React. Previously, I had worked extensively with Vue.js and always believed Vue was superior due to its simplicity. However, throughout this project, I gained a deeper appreciation for React’s strengths. I discovered that React’s modular structure makes it easier to break down complex features, and its flexibility is a huge advantage when scaling applications for larger projects.

### Launching True Devtools

After about 2 weeks of development and testing, I was finally ready to launch True Devtools. To get the word out, I decided to share it with the J2Team Community—a Facebook group I’m part of, where developers share useful resources. I didn’t expect much, but to my surprise, the J2Team Community admin liked the app so much that he decided to share it on his TikTok channel.

The results were mind-blowing. Within just 24 hours, True Devtools had received over <b>30,000 visits</b>! It was an overwhelming response that made me realize how much developers value having a single place to access the tools they use every day. I was ecstatic and humbled by the support.

### Reflecting on the Experience

Building True Devtools has been an incredible journey. I’ve learned a lot about the development process, from crafting intuitive user interfaces to optimizing for performance. But the most rewarding part of this experience has been seeing how much others appreciate the tools I’ve built. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the simplest ideas can have the biggest impact.

If you’re a developer who’s tired of hopping between different websites for basic tasks, I encourage you to give True Devtools a try. It’s free, it’s easy to use, and it’s designed to make your life a little bit easier.
