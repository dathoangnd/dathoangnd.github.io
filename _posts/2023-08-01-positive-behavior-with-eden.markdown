title:  "Positive Behaviors with Eden"

> We do not choose the future. We choose our habits, and our habits will determine the future.

This is the tagline of the Eden app, one of my favorite apps on the iPhone. This app helps us create and track daily habits.

What's interesting is that every time you complete a habit for the day, it makes the flower in the app grow a little. If you skip a day, it will wither. By maintaining regular habits, the flower will grow and eventually form a whole garden.

The reason I love this app is because of its simple interface, which allows me to focus on completing my habits without worrying about how to use it. Also, the music in the app is very soothing, with sound effects like rain, wind, forest, and ocean waves.

I paid for the full version of the app, which allows me to choose from more types of flowers to grow, which is interesting.
