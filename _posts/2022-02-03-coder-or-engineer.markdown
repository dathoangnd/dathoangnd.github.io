title:  "Coder or Engineer?"
---
When talking about programmers, people often have two opposing perspectives:  
- "Studying IT these days just means ending up unemployed or barely earning enough to get by."  
- "Programmers probably just sit around all day and make a ton of money every month, right?"  

In my opinion, both of these thoughts can hold some truth, depending on whether the programmer is a **Coder** or an **Engineer**.  

Informally, programmers can be categorized with different titles:  
- **Coder**: These are individuals focused on writing code to meet requirements. They create functional software products, which may or may not be of high quality. However, they often overlook aspects such as scalability, maintainability, or the long-term value of their software. Coders fulfill specific tasks, receive their compensation, and move on.  
- **Programmer**: These are technically skilled individuals who produce well-structured, high-quality software with clean, maintainable code. However, their primary focus is on the technical excellence of the product rather than its business value or user impact.  
- **Developer**: Developers possess both technical skills and a broader understanding of product value. They ensure that features and software align with user needs and business goals. A Developer considers whether a feature adds value or solves a problem for users and prioritizes accordingly.  
- **Engineer**: Engineers combine deep technical knowledge with practical problem-solving skills. They design, build, and maintain complex systems while ensuring scalability, efficiency, and reliability. Engineers are responsible for the end-to-end lifecycle of software products, from architecture to deployment.  

Most companies refer to their programmers as Developers or Engineers. The critical difference between these roles lies not just in technical expertise or experience—both of which can improve over time—but in their mindset, passion, and commitment to software development as a craft. Engineers and Developers are typically proactive learners who continuously seek ways to solve problems better.  

As for myself, a programmer still learning and growing, I would still humbly consider myself an Engineer.

The titles mentioned above are, of course, relative and meant for perspective. What matters most is not what others call you, but your ability to deliver meaningful work and grow in your craft.
