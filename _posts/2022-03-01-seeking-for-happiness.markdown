title:  "Seeking for Happiness"
---
From the moment we are born, we carry countless questions about ourselves: What is the meaning of my life? What career will I pursue? How will I live? What will people think of me? There’s a saying that goes:

> You are born twice: once when your parents bring you into the world, and again when you discover why you were born.

Me, too, have always carried this question with me. I’ve tried learning many things and working in various fields until one day, I realized something—a simple truth that can summarize the meaning of life for everyone:

> You are born to seek happiness.

Happiness is the most important thing each of us must find for ourselves. Your parents cannot provide you with lifelong happiness, nor can others do it for you. You must take responsibility for your own happiness. To me, achieving happiness requires fulfillment in two key areas: material and spiritual.

Material fulfillment means:

- Having a healthy body.
- Having enough to eat, enough to wear, a place to live, and transportation.
- Being able to afford some non-essential services without significantly impacting your personal finances.
- Being able to help your parents, loved ones, or even strangers.

Spiritual fulfillment means:

- Having an optimistic spirit.
- Doing work you love.
- Living your passions.
- Treating others well.
- Being respected by others.
- Finding joy in giving without expecting anything in return.

Each person have a different perspective, and the two lists above might be longer or shorter for different individuals. However, material and spiritual fulfillment are both essential for true happiness. Lacking either will leave it incomplete.

There’s an old saying, *“You can’t practice virtue on an empty stomach,”* which couldn’t be more accurate. If someone doesn’t have a stable job or income, can’t take care of themselves or their family, and spends every day struggling to meet basic needs, it’s hard to imagine how they could be happy. Of course, one shouldn’t obsess over earning money to the point of neglecting life’s joys—balance is key—but achieving financial security is a necessary foundation.

As for spiritual fulfillment, it is perhaps even more important than material wealth. You need to maintain optimism, think positively, and nurture harmonious relationships. Whether you’re happy or sad, the Earth keeps spinning, and life goes on. Yet, life is full of surprises, and difficulties are inevitable. There will be moments of frustration and disappointment. I’ve had my fair share of feeling down and complaining, but I see these moments as reminders that I’m just a normal human. What’s important is working to change your mindset and embracing positivity as quickly as possible.

I hope that by sharing this, I can spread a little positivity to you. I wish that you, find your own happiness.
